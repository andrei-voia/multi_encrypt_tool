# MultiEncrypt Tool

* This is a personal encryption tool, easy to use with user-friendly interface,
* You have a vast variety of encrypting possibilities for your secret message,
* You have many encrypting options to choose from, depending on your needs,
* This multiencrypt tool has multiple encryption layers, more than 12 different methods,
* The more layers of encryption you use, the harder to crack the code will be.

## MultiEncrypt interface

This is how the MultiEncrypt tool looks like for the user

## How to use

You have many possibilities for encrypting a text

* The first thing you want to choose is whether you want to use a Key or not. A Key is used to encrypt a text and you can't decrypt it if you don't have that very Key. If you choose "No-Key" option, then the encryption algorithm will integrate a random key in the encryptioned text.

* Another thing to consider is the "Difficulty Steps". This is how you can choose how powerful the encryption will be. Basicly, the higher it is, the harder will be to crack the code. This modifies the number of encrypting layers the program uses.

* The "Type" will be either "Normal" or "Safe". The "Normal" option will just encrypt the text while the "Safe" option will check the encrypted text to see if it was correctly encrypted. Basicly this will use an extra step of checking for possible errors.
